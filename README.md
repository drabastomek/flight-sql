# Arrow FlightSQL example

## Setup

In order to run this example you need to set up a new environment on your machine. 
Follow these steps to do so (thanks to David Li!).

1. Make sure you have [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your machine. 
2. Install Mamba: `conda install -c conda-forge mamba`.
3. Now, create a new dev environment
```bash
$ mamba create -n flight-sql -c conda-forge python=3.9
$ conda activate flight-sql
$ 
```
4. Build and install Arrow
```bash
$ cd scripts && ./build_arrow.sh
```
7. Build and install `duckdb`. This is sometimes necessary as conda `compilers` 
seem to be including incompatible GlibC library with the compiled binaries
of `duckdb`.
```bash
$ ./build_duckdb.sh
```
6. Get the data.
```bash
$ mkdir ../data
$ wget https://github.com/lovasoa/TPCH-sqlite/releases/download/v1.0/TPC-H-small.db -O ../data/TPC-H-small.db
```
7. Create duckdb database.
```bash
$ ./get_duckdb_database.sh
```
9. Build the example.
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/cmake/arrow
$ ninja && ./flight_sql
```

## Docker
You can build a Docker container which performs all of the setup steps above.   

### To build on an x86-based machine:
```bash
docker build . --build-arg BUILD_PLATFORM="linux/amd64" --tag=flight_sql_amd64:latest

# Then run the container with:
docker run -it flight_sql_amd64:latest
```

### To build on an M1 (ARM)-based Mac:
```bash
docker build . --build-arg BUILD_PLATFORM="linux/arm64" --tag=flight_sql_arm64:latest

# Then run the container with:
docker run -it flight_sql_arm64:latest
```

## Selecting different backends
This example allows chosing from two backends: SQLite and DuckDB. It defaults to DuckDB.

```bash
$ ./flight_sql
> duckdb server listening on localhost:31337
> Connected to server: localhost:31337
> Client created.
> ...
```

The above call is equivalent to running `./flight_sql -B duckdb` or `./flight_sql --backend duckdb`. To select SQLite run

```bash
$ ./flight_sql -B sqlite
```
or 
```bash
$ ./flight_sql --backend sqlite
```
The above will produce the following:

```bash
> sqlite server listening on localhost:31337
> Connected to server: localhost:31337
> Client created.
> ...
```

## Printing results of running query
This example defaults to running the queries but does not print out
the query itself nor does it print the results. To switch to printing
results and queries set the `print` flag to `true`.

```bash
$ ./flight_sql --print true
```

## Print help
To see all the available options run `./flight.sql --help`.

```bash
> Allowed options:
>   --help                         produce this help message
>   -B [ --backend ] arg (=duckdb) Specify the database backend. Allowed options:
>                                  duckdb, sqlite.
>   --print arg (=false)           Print the results of running queries. Allowed 
>                                  options: false, true.
```
